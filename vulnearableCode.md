# Vulnerable Code Description

## Endpoint for Password Reset (/forgot-password)

This code defines an endpoint at `/forgot-password` to handle POST requests for password recovery.

### Email Validation:

- Utilizes the Joi library to validate the email with an appropriate pattern.
- If the email fails validation, it responds with a 400 status and an error message.

### User Search:

- Uses the User model to search for a user with the provided email in the request.
- If the user is not found, it responds with a 404 status and a "User not found" message.

### Reset Token Generation:

- Utilizes the crypto library to generate a secure token with a length of 32 bytes.
- Hashes the generated token using the SHA-256 algorithm for enhanced security.
- Sets an expiration time for the token (here, it's set to expire in one hour).

### Token Storage in the Database:

- Stores the hashed token along with the expiration time in the database for the user.

### Sending Email with Token:

- Uses the `sendResetEmail` function to send an email with the generated token to the user.

### Client Response:

- Upon success, it responds with a 200 status and a message saying "Reset email sent successfully."
- In case of an error, it responds with a 500 status and an "Internal Server Error" message.

Note: Ensure that the * sign indicates a required field.
